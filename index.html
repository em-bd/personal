                    <p> Throughout my time at Iowa State, I have been heavily involved in Frontend design and Software development. I've helped family with developing
                        websites and getting set up with enterprise software for their quilt shop in Iowa Falls, worked Frontend for multiple class projects, and
                        done website design in my freetime.
                        <br> <br>
                        I have a deep passion for music and serving my community; I have participated in the Iowa State Marching Band and Basketball Pep Bands since 2020, 
                        with 2022 being my first year on the leadership team. I was also initiated into Tau Beta Sigma, a National Honorary Band Sorority dedicated to 
                        community service and empowering women in music, in 2020 and have served as the Chapter president since 2023.

                        </div>
                        <p> Every year, Reiman Gardens hosts a Spirit of the Gardens event in October, where 1200+ pumpkins are carved and displayed 
                            for each week of the event. Volunteers are requested to help cut out stencils, trace stencils onto pumpkins, and carve them.                            
                            All pumpkin statuses are stored in a single excel sheet, where Admins must manually adjust the statuses of each stencil&mdash;whether
                            they've been printed, cut out, traced, carved, and put out for display. Additionally, volunteers for Spirits of the Gardens
                            will help select stencils to be used for each week of the event, which takes an additional step of marking down which week(s)
                            a stencil is available for. As the stencil database keeps growing, this process is becoming increasingly time-consuming.
                            <br> <br>
                            To aid with this issue, I'm currently working with Nathan Brockman&mdash;one of the faculty members at Reiman Gardens&mdash;on a team of
                            Software Engineers to develop a app called Pumpkin Tracker to make tracking information quickly and accurately. Pumpkin Tracker 
                            plans to facilitate interactions with the stencil database by allowing Event Admins to easily add, delete, update, and archive 
                            stencils with the simple click of a few buttons as opposed to manually editing a row in an excel sheet that contains 1600+ entries. 
                            A Stencil Management page will also been included, which allows Admins to update stencil statuses by either confirming or overriding
                            their current status. We implemented barcode scanner functionality to provide a batch update option, where Admins can quickly scan 
                            barcodes of any stencils that were returned and further expedite the process. A Volunteer app is also being developed, which both provides
                            engagement for those volunteering to help cut and trace stencils as well as eventually provide time estimates for how much work
                            each stencil will take and updates to stencil statuses that will then be confirmed by an Admin.

                            I am primarily working on Frontend for the development of the Mobile and Web Application, which is being set up as a 
                            React app. This involves working extensively with ReactDOM, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Our database is running on SQLite
                            and is planned to be hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet in August. Our team adopted an Agile project development style since we
                            need to present each design iteration to our client, Nathan Brockman, to receive feedback on user satisfaction and conduct continuous
                            software testing as we integrate new features.

                        <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Terminal displays for map and battle sequence</p>
                        <p> This class project is dedicated to understanding memory management and other advanced coding techniques in C/C++ while
                            creating a roguelite version of Pok&eacute;mon. Functionalities like dynamic GUI, NPC AI, map 
                            generation, map traversal, and battle mechanics were required as a baseline for developing a roguelite with the 
                            freedom to add additional features. As an avid Pok&eacute;mon fan since Gen 4, I programmed this with attempts to
                            remain faithful to the mechanics of the original Pok&eacute;mon games.
                            <br> <br>
                            Dynamic memory management was vital to this project, especially considering the full map grid would be comprised of a total of 400
                            randomly generated maps and at least 7 randomly generated NPCs per map, each having 3 random pok&eacute;mon in their party. Maps would
                            only be generated upon the PC encountering them, which they would be stored in a world data grid for potential use later use or get free'd 
                            once the program is terminated. Instead of printing out each map to the terminal, the ncurses library in C/C++ was included to provide a
                            dynamically changing GUI for the player. 
                            <br> <br>
                            The game is set on a turn loop, with the PC having the highest priority; all NPCs are waiting
                            for the PC to complete their turn before taking theirs. NPC's turn decisions are dependent on their behavior (friendly, neutral, or 
                            aggressive) toward the PC and, if aggressive, will determine their next move based on the move costs calculated by an implementation of
                            dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding to the PC. If the PC gets ensnared into a wild or trainer battle, the battle UI window will be
                            displayed, allowing the PC to either use an item, fight with the current pok&eacute;mon's moves, switch out with one of their 
                            party pok&eacute;mon, or run (if it's a wild battle). Data for items, pok&eacute;mon species, movesets, moves, types, statuses, etc. had to be 
                            parsed from CSV files provided in a database accessible in the Pyrite server, which get loaded up at runtime prior to  generating the 
                            first map of the game.
                            <br> <br>
                            By using these techniques and combining these features, I created a functional roguelite version of Pok&eacute;mon playable in an 80x24 terminal.
                            Additional functionalities that weren't required but I still implemented include type matchups, solo and party leveling, shiny chances, and 
                            the Pok&eacute;mon Storage System.

                         <br>
                         <p> Patient data confidentiality and management has high priority in all healthcare service environments. With the growth of
                             technology and increasing risks in cyber security, confidentiality has become a large area of concern. Healthcare providers
                             also desire software solutions for managing and booking appointments, reading and writing to patient data, and providing their
                             availability to their patients.
                             <br> <br>
                             I worked with a group of other students to design a Mobile app we named CyHealth to resolve this issue. I was one of 2 members
                             delegated to the Frontend, where we developed views for Patients, Receptionists, Doctors/Nurses, and Admins. We evaluated user profiles
                             and the privileges they needed, which boiled down to: Doctors/Nurses having access to all patient data (diagnoses, prescriptions, etc.), 
                             their own availability and scheduled appointments with patients, and any appointment requests; Receptionists having access to Patient 
                             appointment requests and bookings as well as availabilities of all Doctors/Nurses; Patients having access to their personal data, appointment
                             requests and bookings, and test results; and Admins having access to privileges of workers (Doctors/Nurses and Receptionists).
                             <br> <br>
                             We developed XML files and Java script files in Android Studio for the Frontend and Maven Projects with IntelliJ for the Backend. To
                             enable client-server communication, we utilized REST API through HTTP requests and established Websockets throughout the app, which 
                             Websockets were set in places where it was appropriate to receive real-time updates (i.e., Patient appointment request notifications
                             sent to Receptionist views).
