                    <p>Frontend developer for Websites and Web apps. 
                        
                        Throughout my time at Iowa State, I have been heavily involved in Frontend design and Software development.
                        I helped develop software in Python for CYSAT-2&mdash;a cube satellite&mdash;that was deployed in October 2024, 
                        coded Pok&eacute;mon in C/C++ by providing ASCII visual representations in a terminal, and developed mobile and web apps
                        for various class projects. I'm currently working with a team of Software Engineers to develop an application
                        for Reiman Gardens' Spirit of the Gardens Event that will launch in October 2025.
                        <br><br>
                        I've worked as a Computer Support Technician for the Music & Theater Department at Iowa State since August 2023,
                        and later joined as a Recording Engineer in January 2024.

                        <br>
                        <p> Every year, Reiman Gardens hosts a Spirit of the Gardens event in October, where 1200+ pumpkins are carved and displayed 
                            for each week of the event. Volunteers are requested to help cut out stencils, trace stencils onto pumpkins, and carve them.                            
                            All pumpkin statuses are stored in a single excel sheet, where Admins must manually adjust the statuses of each stencil&mdash;whether
                            they've been printed, cut out, traced, carved, and put out for display. Additionally, volunteers for Spirits of the Gardens
                            will help select stencils to be used for each week of the event, which takes an additional step of marking down which week(s)
                            a stencil is available for. As the stencil database keeps growing, this process is becoming egregiously time-consuming.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To aid with this issue, I'm currently working with Nathan Brockman&mdash;one of the faculty at Reiman Gardens&mdash;on a team of
                            Software Engineers to develop a app called Pumpkin Tracker to make tracking information quickly and accurately. Pumpkin Tracker 
                            plans to facilitate interactions with the stencil database by allowing Event Admins to easily add, delete, update, and archive 
                            stencils with the simple click of a few buttons as opposed to manually editing a row in an excel sheet that contains 1600+ entries. 
                            A Stencil Management page will also been included, which allows Admins to update stencil statuses by either confirming or overriding
                            their current status. We implemented barcode scanner functionality to provide a batch update option, where Admins can quickly scan 
                            barcodes of any stencils that were returned and further expedite the process. A Volunteer app is also being developed, which both provides
                            engagement for those volunteering to help cut and trace stencils as well as eventually provide time estimates for how much work
                            each stencil will take and updates to stencil statuses that will then be confirmed by an Admin.

                            I am primarily working on Frontend for the development of the Mobile and Web Application, which is being set up as a 
                            React app. This involves working extensively with ReactDOM, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. Our database is running on SQLite
                            and is planned to be hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet in August.

                        <p> This class project was dedicated to understanding memory management and other advanced coding techniques in C/C++ while
                            creating a roguelite version of Pok&eacute;mon. Functionalities like a dynamic GUI, NPC AI, map 
                            generation, CSV parsing, and battle mechanics were required as a baseline for developing a roguelite with the 
                            freedom to add additional features. As an avid Pok&eacute;mon fan since Gen 4, I programmed this with attempts to
                            remain faithful to the mechanics in the original Pok&eacute;mon games.
